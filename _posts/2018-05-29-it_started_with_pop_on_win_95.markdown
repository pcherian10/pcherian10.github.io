I vividly remember my first exposure to computers. In what was a rather dull building in the heart of the city of Bangalore, India where I had spent my early childhood, rows of monitors and keyboards snaked through a modest room, where my mother and her colleagues clacked away on rickety keyboards. She was a programmer, and during a visit to her office,  one of her colleagues had shown me a computer game, so I wouldn't be bored while I waited for her to wrap up work. It was the Prince of Persia, and I was hooked. I played interminably, until I pulled away by my mother, who was in a perpetual hurry as a result of holding down a full time job and raising my sister and myself.

From that point on, I had beckoned to go back to the office numerous times to play and went whenever possible. It was the genesis of my passion for gaming, technology, and programming. I was an avid gamer through my teenage years, and in college I had pursued programming briefly before being sidetracked. I had decided to pursue business degrees, in lieu of technology solely for the fact that programming was all too familiar to me growing up. I wanted to explore try other career fields. The notion that familiarity breeds contempt rings true here. I landed my first job in finance as an investment researcher and proceeded to work in the field for almost six years. 

Fast-forward to just about a year ago, and I found that I was simply going through the motions in an office cubicle. I knew I was unhappy and that the end of my finance career was near. Upon trying my hand at coding challenges on various sites, I knew I could love coding again. I saw the Flatiron School's offering, and decided that it was very well-thought out and seamlessly fit into my life. I ended up leaving my job in finance a few months ago and am spending my time learning to code full-time, and with the intention of gaining full time employment in industry upon graduating!
