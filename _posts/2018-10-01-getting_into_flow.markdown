One of the most challenging aspects of learning a new skill is achieving a minimum threshold of focus and maintaining it throughout the pursuit of the task.  The challenge is further elevated by the need to replicate the same level of focus through multiple sessions and over a large period of time. Without this focus, you're at best inefficient and at worst, unable to get any work done, having spent hours surfing the web, succumbing to social media distractions and watching funny cat videos on youtube. With the source of work and source of distraction stemming from the same place (i.e, the web) the programmer's plight to achieving this state is exacerbated by multiple orders of magnitude.

While I'd heard of flow-state before, I didn't quite understand its importance to the programmer's workflow until I had a) experienced it first-hand consciously and b) failed to experience after trying to attain it. [Flow ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))is well documented on the web, but it was relatively new concept to me when I had started my journey as a programmer. In my prior life as financial analyst, if I'd achieved flow it was esconced by the immense pressure and stress of the job. I had of course achieved flow, but it was driven by finishing a task that had tight deadline and a boss that was waiting on the other end like a hungry lion awaiting a meal; I'd get chewed out if I didn't deliver on time. 

In my first brushes with programming, I was only somewhat conscious of where my mind wandered without the aforementioned pressure, because it wasn't so much that a task had been handed down to me to to complete but rather, it was me attempting to solve a problem or build something that didn't have an immediate natural time-constraint. Thus, if I did get into flow, I wasn't trying to. Upon falling into it, I had then just thought that I was happy to be where I was, doing what I was doing and that everything was right in the world. My first introduction to the term and the notion was actually during  a Tim Ferriss podcast, where a guest had mentioned it (I forget the episode but more about Tim Ferriss's thoughts on flow and related articles can be found pretty easily with a google search). I immediately recognized the euphoric, powerful feeling that I'd felt previously and started researching it obsessively. From that point on, a concurrent goal to my mastery of web dev skills, was the pursuit of an on/off switch for flow.

Over the past few months, I've experimented somewhat extensively on the things that actually get me the most focus. While I won't provide a detailed breakdown of the trial and error process, I will provide the things that currently work for me and this is essentially my routine/ritual or the "ON" button. I will say that this works best for me when I've been eating healthy, exercising and getting a decent amount of sleep (6+ hours).  These are the things I do after finding a comfortable seat and a good work environment (i.e in a coffee shop or a WeWork). Headphones are a must. 

1. First, I open up Spotify and listen to one of two playlists. [This](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5SgJR30RfzR5hO21TsQhBp), if you're in a lower energy state and need to get up higher or [this](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/41QjOoffs3nC7bKb2QvbDx), if you're in a higher energy state and need to come down a bit before starting. They're both great for background music.

2. Get your hands on a [Pomodoro Timer App](http://https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/focusme-a-pomodoro-timer/koebbleaefghpjjmghelhjboilcmfpad?hl=en) and turn this on. The default setting is 25 minutes, but I actually prefer it to be closer to 15 or 20 minutes, especially during the first few rounds. This app is also great because it comes with a website blocker that you can turn on and turn off. Once you fill your block list, it automatically disables websites when you are in a work interval.

3. For the first interval, I read a non-fiction book. I'd also recommend doing an easy Sudoku - I use this [app](http://https://www.embed.com/sudoku/). This is essentially warm-up for the mind. I might spend as many as two intervals here, but usually just one, especially nowadays after having spent a decent amount of time fine-tuning the approach.

4. At this point, I'm usually well on my way to getting to flow. However, during my first break I start sipping tea or coffee to further elevate and solidify the state. 

That's it! Rinse and repeat. During subsequent breaks, I walk around a bit and stretch as well. I find, however, after a few intervals, that I turn off the app and am deep into flow with the app now distraction instead :). That's when I know that  I'm in the best state of flow. Don't forget to grab a snack once in a while to make sure you have the energy to maintain. If you do fall out of flow - just turn the timer back on and repeat step 3.

Hope this helps you in your coding journey!
